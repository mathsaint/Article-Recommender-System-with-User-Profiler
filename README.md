# Article Recommender System with User Profiler

This project was done as part of our IDC410 Machine Learning Course at IISER Mohali.

The article recommendation system is built on an LDA model. We've tried a novel approach for generating user profiles based on a markov chain, which gave us realistic profiles and sampled particularly well. 

A preliminary analysis was done before the implementation, the results of which are mentioned in the Preliminary Analysis file. Do give it a glance to get a better context of our approach.
